# GA Communication SCSS/CSS Code Standards

These standards were cobbled together by the fine folks at GA from the following resources:

*http://css-tricks.com/sass-style-guide/
*https://github.com/styleguide/css
*http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml

```css
.class {
  text-align: left;
}
```
